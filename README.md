## Development note
This got much more popular than I thought it would be. I expected maybe a dozen people who would be interested in it, and I was planning on developing it bit by bit. I will need some time to address every issue and add all the new requested features. I haven't used git with an open source project before, so it is a bit overwhelming. 

## LinguaCafe
LinguaCafe is a free self-hosted software that helps language learners learn vocabulary by reading. It provides a set of tools to read, look up unknown words and review them later on as effortlessly as possible.

You can read about all the features of LinguaCafe in this [overview](https://simjanos-dev.github.io/LinguaCafeHome/).

## Installation (Windows)
I couldn't install docker on windows yet. I will try to figure it out in the future, however if you manage to install and run docker on Windows, the commands should be the same, except you won't need "sudo chmod 777 ./* -R".

## Installation (Linux)
Step 1: Install docker desktop

Step 2: Download LinguaCafe code and run these commands from the directory of LinguaCafe and wait about a minute for the setup to complete.
> sudo chmod 777 ./* -R  
> docker compose up -d  

Your server now should be running and accessible on http://localhost:9191.  

If you want to learn Japanese, it is highly recommended that you also import the JMDict files by following the steps below.

## JMDict import (recommended for Japanese)
Step 1: Download JMDict files.  

Download all the processed JMDict files from the [lastest release](https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LangApp/releases) on github. Download the .txt and .xml  files, ignore the "Source code" files.

Step 2: Copy the files into the LinguaCafe/storage/app/dictionaries/ directory.  

Step 3: Login to LinguaCafe, and run these import scripts from your browser:

> http://localhost:9191/jmdict/import-jmdict  
> http://localhost:9191/jmdict/import-kanji  
> http://localhost:9191/jmdict/import-radicals

## Dictionaries for German, Spanish and Norwegian
You can find dictionaries [here](https://github.com/simjanos-dev/Dictionaries) for these languages, and instructions on how to import them.
I will add more sources in the future. If you know of any, I would appreciate it if you would send them to me.

## Jellyfin docker config for new server

You do not need Jellyfin at all to use LinguaCafe, it is just an additional feature.

There is a pre-written configuration file for Jellyfin + LinguaCafe in docker-compose-jellyfin.yml if you do not have a Jellyfin server yet. This will set up both LinguaCafe and Jellyfin for you.

Replace these paths with your own in docker-compose-jellyfin.yml:
> - /your/path/to/config:/config
> - /your/path/to/cache:/cache
> - /your/path/to/media:/media:ro


Then run the installation commands, but replace
> docker compose up -d  

with 

> docker compose -f ./docker-compose-jellyfin.yml up -d

## Jellyfin docker config for already existing Jellyfin server
If you already have a Jellyfin server, you can you this example to connect Jellyfin's network with LinguaCafe.
There are probably multiple ways to do it, the only requirement is that linguacafe-webserver should be able to reach Jellyfin's server.

```
version: '3.5'
networks:
    linguacafe_linguacafe:
        external: true

services:
    jellyfin:
        image: jellyfin/jellyfin
        container_name: jellyfin
        user: 1000:1000
        volumes:
            - /path/to/config:/config
            - /path/to/cache:/cache
            - /path/to/media:/media:ro
        restart: 'unless-stopped'
        ports:
            - 8096:8096
        networks:
            - linguacafe_linguacafe
```

## Jellyfin API usage
Step 1: Create an API key in Jellyfin. You can do this on the Dashboard -> API Keys menu.  

Step 2: Set the created API key in LinguaCafe on to the Admin->API menu.

Step 3: Set the Jellyfin host in LinguaCafe on to the Admin->API menu. If you used one of the pre-written configs, it should be the default http://jellyfin:8096.

Step 4: Save the settings. 

Now you should be able to read any external subtitles from any TV Show you play in any of your Jellyfin clients on the Media player page. 
Unfortunately there is the noticable lag when you click on a timestamp to jump to a subtitle. I could only make it work without delays with the native "Jellyfin media player" client on my PC.  

At this time it only works with TV Shows due to a bug, it will be fixed soon. Later on there will be also an option to save the subtitles in the library like any text.

## Anki
Anki is supported, if your server and Anki run on the same PC (this will not be a requirement in the future) and have [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) plugin installed. 

## DeepL Translate
DeepL is a machine translation service that let's you translate up to 500.000 characters/month for free and is supported by LinguaCafe. You can set your DeepL Translate API key in the admin API settings. 

## Active evelopement disclaimer
LinguaCafe is still in active development. There are a few missing features, and you might encounter some bugs while using the software. Please test it before you start actively using it, and make sure it is up to your expectations.  

At this time only one user/server is supported.  

I will soon add support for multiple users on one server, write detailed instructions for Windows install and create an easier installation experience if possible.
